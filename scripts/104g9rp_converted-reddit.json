        "message": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;#39;m a neuroscientist. Not an expert on this specific issue. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The visual cortex is still there in blind people but it does not develop properly for vision (more below!) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Brains are very plastic and the visual cortex gets coopted to help other senses. Resources are rarely wasted in the brain!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it is no longer useful for vision after a fairly early age. Many years ago, a surgery was developed to remove congenital cataracts. This allowed some people, as adults, who had been blind from birth to be able to use their eyes for the first time. However, their brains had not properly developed to interpret visual information. So instead of the coherent visual picture that we get, it was all a gigantic mess. Objects were disjointed, things that were not moving would drift across their field division in different ways. Stuff would happen like if you were looking at someone&amp;#39;s face, their eyes would move around and pass each other, and the nose would drift down or something. It was by and large not very successful for most people, and many of the people who had the surgery actually opted to going back to being blind.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
