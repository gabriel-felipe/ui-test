        "message": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA, when left untreated, can increase the pressures in the right side of your heart. Most people are familiar with high blood pressure and controlling your blood pressure which is most commonly linked to the left side of your heart. But there’s also pressure within the pulmonary vasculature. The right side of the heart is not as Muscular as the left side, as the left side clearly has to pump blood throughout the entire body. When our airway is occluded, such as with sleep apnea over a long period of time, the right side of the heart increases the amount of work it has to do to pump the blood through the lungs. When your brain has a drop in oxygen, which occurs with OSA, the body believes it is lacking oxygen, and so it makes the right side of the heart pump harder to push blood to the lungs to get oxygen, and then return the blood left side of the heart and pump it to the rest of the body, including the brain. The pressure within the pulmonary system normally is less than 30 whereas most people are familiar with having a low blood pressure of 120/80, so you can see that the normal pressure within the pulmonary system is much much lower than that of the systemic blood pressure normally used to hearing about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the right side of the heart continues to work hard, just like any muscle, it increases in size causing an increase in your pulmonary artery pressure, causing pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to shortness of breath, debility, dyspnea with exertion, lower extremity swelling (just to name a few). These things can lead to a decrease in your overall activity level, which could then lead to a more sedentary lifestyle, which has an effect on the longevity and quality of life in an individual. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heart failure, regardless if it’s left side or right side, is a chronic condition. A serious form of heart failure is called cor pulmonale. This is when the right side of the heart fails and can cause severe issues, including the collapse of the left ventricle if the right ventricle becomes too large. If the left ventricle collapses then it makes it almost impossible for the left side to pump blood throughout the rest of the body leading to very critical conditions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps, there are many benefits of utilizing CPAP or BiPAP therapy if you have a obstructive sleep apnea. If you or your loved ones, believe they have obstructive sleep apnea, it is advised to talk to your primary care physician, or general practitioner going forward..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "message": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your breathing is literally vital. You need oxygen in constant and consistent supply to ensure your cells have the fuel they need to continue what they&amp;#39;re doing moment to moment. You also need to dispose of CO2 to maintain good pH balance in your blood. When you aren&amp;#39;t doing that, you&amp;#39;re body as a whole tries to take drastic action to preserve oxygen supply, which is good when used short term, but very bad of used chronically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;#39;s say you have sleep apnea. And at night, you stop breathing. You don&amp;#39;t notice consciously, because you&amp;#39;re asleep. But you have receptors in your vessels that do notice the change in pH that has occurred because there is more acidic CO2 in your blood now. The body tried to compensate by increasing pulse and blood pressure, to try to force the blood to go around faster and into the tissues more to offload more oxygen. But there&amp;#39;s not much to go around. Your body also starts spiking your cortisol to try to wake you up because this is serious. And so you kind of do wake up long enough to start to breathe normally, then fall back to sleep and the cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you stop breathing once and have this response once, that&amp;#39;s ok. But if you&amp;#39;re constantly doing this overnight, you&amp;#39;re not sleeping right, which is bad for you functioning and it&amp;#39;s bad for your brain health. Your heart and blood vessels are progressively stained by this, and they are also deprived of oxygen. We don&amp;#39;t fully understand all the pathways that produce harm from sleep apnea, but it does follow that chronic deprivation of oxygen is going to harm your normal function in a variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does that make sense? If not I can try to explain better&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

            "message": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I’m a family Doc I’m on leave for personal reasons and to write some literature and presentations so I have some time to help some internet strangers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your intro above is a great start to the discussion but there’s more, there’s always more to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER: this is general info not specific to OP and I recommend anyone with concerns for a sleep related breathing disorder see a qualified physician or healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea (SA) comes in 2 flavors Central (CSA) and obstructive (OSA). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CSA is less common but it might be present in up to 1% of the population, it is usually secondary or associated with another condition. It is essentially when your brain forgets to tell you body to inhale while you sleep. It can be associated with things like heart failure, arrhythmias but in my experience it is usually due to one of 2 underlying problems. 1-A neurodegenerative condition (think things like MS, ALS, or most recently a chap with Charcot Marie Tooth syndrome), or 2-due to medications such as opioids or more commonly patients on methadone based use disorder treatment. There’s also an interesting association with HIV infection too. But I’ve noticed with the advent of excellent anti-retrovirals I’ve seen less and less discussion of this in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OSA is much more common, one could argue it is present in epidemic proportions. In this case the pro/nasopharyngeal soft tissue is hypertrophied and as we sleep lying on our backs that tissue relaxes because its full of smother muscle fibers and everything falls backwards blocking the airway. Oxygen actually tends to stay normal for quite a while before it starts dropping off (low O2 sats), but what goes up is your CO2 and this is what your brains notices and disturbs your sleep (Interestingly this is the circuit that is faulty in CSA). Back to the closed airway…when this happens your lung muscles wil continue to try and push air out this increases the pressure in the thoracic cavity which in turn compresses the Vena cava (return route to the heart) this reduces the ability of the heart to “prime” its pumping mechanism thus reducing its output and the resultant low Oxygen. Now to compensate the heart like any other muscle will get stranger (Hypertrophied), this is pathological because while it might maintain things while your asleep when you wake up that extra push on the pump is still present so your BP goes up (hypertension) and because of the thick walls of the heart it becomes less and less efficient (Heart failure) these increase the risk of MI and stoke and thus OSA is a major risk factor for them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Treatment is similar for both, we have to constantly push air into the airway so it stays open (CPAP) there are variations but that’s the basics of treatment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this is the important bit…when I talk to my patients about this they are understandably not excited about sleeping attached to a machine. I explain to them that there are 2 perspectives; for me I want to treat it because I know if I can control it I can prevent or delay cardiovascular disease, for them though I explain they should feel less fatigued, wake up with less headaches, have less depression, and more energy. When we get the setup right patients invariably fell much better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tidbits: If you have OSA take an old t-shirt and sew a tennis ball into the front and back, this will stop you sleeping on your front or back, OSA is reduced by 20-30% in side sleepers. Some of us are very excited about the massive uptick in interest in obesity medications especially ozempic (semalglutide), right now due to our wonderful payer system its out of reach for a lot of people but as it becomes more available and we treat obesity more effectively we should see a resultant reduction in OSA syndromes. But that will take years for us to be able to make that connection through research studies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry to prattle on I love explaining things like this to my patients&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: words and spelling&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: WOW I was not expecting so many responses thanks to all who asked great questions, remember speak to your PCPs, bring a list, and if you need to bring a friend as an advocate.\nI’ve gotta go do some non-doctor stuff like shopping and stuff so I’ll check back later&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

I was falling asleep at my desk at work.  I had found places to pull off the highway during my commute, for quick 15 minute naps going to and from work.  That&amp;#39;s how bad it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I get a full 7-8 hours of restful sleep every night.  Total change in my energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;How am I going to be able to sleep with a mask on?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always answer that this way:  Could you sleep with a baseball hat on?  Could you sleep with earbuds in?  Could you sleep with shoes on?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some people wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to.  But a lot of people would be like, yeah, it might take some adjustment, but I could fall asleep with a hat, or earbuds, or shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mask is like that.  It&amp;#39;s a minor thing that you CAN get used to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Aren&amp;#39;t there any drugs, or surgeries, that you can use instead?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CPAPs are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drug free.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Surgery free.  No cutting, no stitches.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can be applied in seconds (rather than scheduling a procedure)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take effect on the first night (rather than buildup of a drug)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zero anesthesia necessary&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zero surgery complications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zero recovery time&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;100% reversible (just take it off)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cheaper than drugs or surgery&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zero side effects from drugs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the very least, those make it such that CPAP should be the first thing you try.  You shouldn&amp;#39;t even think about drugs or surgery until you&amp;#39;ve given CPAP a real, honest, determined try.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Former sleep technologist here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Figured I&amp;#39;d add details on how we work to diagnose OSA, CSA and other sleep disorders in a laboratory setting.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First thing is being hooked up to all sorts of different sensors. We use electrodes on the head to monitor brain activity (limited EEG) to help determine a) what stage of sleep you&amp;#39;re in and b) help us determine if an apnea disrupts your sleep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second thing is a variety of electrodes on various muscles to monitor a) eye movement b) limb movement and c) muscle tone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eye movement is useful in determining sleep stages. Everyone knows about REM sleep, but as you&amp;#39;re falling asleep your eyes will slowly roll side to side!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Limb movement helps us diagnose a syndrome known as Periodic Limb Movement Disorder.. which is exactly what it sounds like and is quite disruptive to one&amp;#39;s sleep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Muscle tone also allows us to determine what stage of sleep someone is in. As someone moves into REM sleep your brain should &amp;quot;paralyze&amp;quot; non-critical muscles. In some patients this system doesn&amp;#39;t work properly leading to something known as REM Behavior Disorder where people can act out their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final things we hook people up to are airflow sensors, and chest/abdomen bands.  The bands record &amp;quot;effort&amp;quot; of breathing while the airflow sensors record... airflow.  In OSA, a person attempts a breath which is picked up by the bands, but there is no airflow.  In CSA there is no effort for breath and no airflow is passed.  Often people will have a single instance of CSA as they fall asleep known as sleep onset CSA which is a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; variant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have various tools to treat OSA/CSA depending on the type/severity. CPAP, BiPAP, and ASV to name a few!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

                    "message": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep on trucking, I agree about the longevity benefits with the CPAP, but there might be a simple pressure or mask adjustment or even an adjunctive med that might help improve your symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again see your PCP this is not medical advice, but what I like doing is having patients bring a list with them to the appointment so that way you address everything you want addressed and then the doc can do their list too. I always ask my patients what’s on their list first because they are more important than me in this relationship. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also rapport is so important I have very few patients who I don’t consider friends as well as patients. Which is part of the reason I’m taking time off, it hurts losing friends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly 2-3 years ago CMS changed billing practices for physicians in order to promote us to spend more time with patients, we used only to get compensated for the complexity or face to face time for patients now the whole process is taken into account so if I spend 30 mins talking with a patient but 1 hr outside of the room coordinating care, notes, referrals etc then I compensated for that too. What that means is the more time I spend with you and making sure your taken care of the better the facility and myself get compensated. Some of us have figured this out and I changed my practice style to ensure I could take more time with my patients, yes it limits numbers but Quality&amp;gt;Quantity, some of us though are not in private practice like me and they are not allowed to change the style to promote quality care. One thing you can do is when you schedule your appointment ask them to block extra time, so I have 15, 30, 45, and 60 min appts and my I educate my patients that if they know that its going to be a tough one to ask my schedulers to give me more time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

For instance we know that if you count steps as an exercise indicator, then there is minimal cardiovascular benefits if those occur in a workplace environment as opposed to if they occur in an organized exercise regimen you get good cardiovascular benefits. We don’t why but personally I suspect it has to do with the mellieu of stress hormone floating around our bodies while we work as opposed to more positive hormones when we exercise. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best example is if I spend an hour doing cpr on a patient no matter what the outcome I will not feel great after but I’ll burn the same amount of calories as if I go ride my mountain bike round my local trails and after I’ll feel good. But we really don’t understand the details of why there is such a difference and if there’s something there we can hijack to improve health.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

(I will not be using his name)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know every other reply in here will be medically technical and fact checkable; but I wanted to share this story because it doesn’t just make me happy, it could literally change your or a loved one’s life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before the CPAP, he literally napped all day every day except for meals, meds, and day hab. Genuinely, the guy laid in bed for like 20 hours a day. Since CPAP, he’s sleeping through most nights, he’s getting up to pee when he needs to, and he’s not trying to sleep in his bed all day. He helps with his laundry and putting dishes away now, and actively participates in a star system that rewards him for good behaviour and proper hygiene. Last month was his 2nd month in a row without missing a star! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He went from being a generally non verbal, constantly sleeping and lethargic, as well as severe constipation, to being a cheerful, happy, expressive guy. He’ll never have full conversational skills due to his low IQ and schizophrenia, but he went from struggling to form single words and needing 5-10 seconds to respond in any fashion, to now being able to talk on the phone with his sister and process what’s happening, and responding in real time. He doesn’t know how to hide his emotions or feelings, really at all, so it’s very straightforward. He will literally outright tell you with a big hearty smile that he is “Happy today!” It makes me feel so good knowing that I was able to help him figure out something that had truly been a serious detriment on his quality of life. He understands now that he’s not capable of taking care of himself all on his own, and has given me a lot of trust because of this CPAP machine. It’s one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

RERA-predominant sleep disordered breathing is called Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome, and its symptoms are somewhat different from apnea- snoring is common but not universal, fatigue instead of sleepiness, cold hands/feet and low pressure, more psychiatric disturbances. Patients are usually normal-weight, but with poor nasal breathing or recessed jaws and slouching.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

On the surface, such data would suggest a dose-response relationship between candesartan and its clinical benefit. &lt;strong&gt;However, when the same analytic approach was applied to those assigned to the placebo arm, the risk of death was again much lower in those with high adherence to placebo. In fact, high adherence to placebo had a several-fold larger effect size on reduced mortality than candesartan itself.&lt;/strong&gt; Given the lack of biologic plausibility that placebo reduces the risk of death in heart failure, the more likely explanation is that those who adhere to study drug (whether candesartan or placebo) have other healthy behaviors, socioeconomic factors, or other unmeasurable confounders that affect outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
