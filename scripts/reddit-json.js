        title: "Google has a history of starting from behind and winning, that's why Microsoft is worried",
        message: "I chuckle when folks claim Stadia doesn't stand a chance. It's amusing to me because I've been around long enough to hear that verdict levied against too many Google products. In fact, I don't ever remember Google launching any products it's entire history that hasn't been initially met with mockery and ridicule.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Phil Spencer, Microsoft's Xbox Chief, had an interview with TheVerge Protocol. He didn't mince words. Stadia is what keeps him awake at night. Not the Playstation 5. Not the Switch. Not GeForce Now. Not Shadow. Not the PC games. But Stadia. As far as I'm concerned Amazon is irrelevant until they launch a game streaming service. I don't consider vaporware to be a threat.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "How can this new platform that has become low hanging fruit, and the butt of the gaming community today, be what worries Phil? Well, I'll tell you why.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Microsoft in the late 90s and early 2000s was the most dominant tech company in the world. Microsoft owned and monopolized the gateway to computing. Anything that mattered in computing was directly or indirectly influenced by Microsoft.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Windows was the de facto computing platform, anything worth doing on a computer had to be done via this OS. Internet Explorer had over 90% market share by the early 2000s. Microsoft Office was how everyone did productivity. Hotmail was how everyone did email. And Messenger was the most popular chat client. Heck, at one point in the early 2000s, I know this is going to sound unbelievable to some of you, but Windows mobile was the most dominant smartphone OS.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Gaming, well at least PC gaming, was exclusively the domain of Windows because once again Microsoft was the gateway to personal computing. It still is to this very day.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "So, if in the late 90s and early 2000s anyone told you that Google, a goofy puny search company that nobody took seriously, was going to fuck Microsoft up so bad, and bring the company to the cusp of irrelevance, you'd have been laughed off the planet. If anyone had told you Google was going to rewrite Microsoft's playbook by forcing their hand and making them pivot from a rich client software vendor to the cloud service provider they are today, your recreational habits would be up for investigation.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Therefore, back in those days, every product Google launched in its infancy was always in the shadow of the behemoth that was Microsoft. And therefore, every product that Google launched was almost always met with an air of irrelevance. Nobody took Google and its product seriously because there was no possible scenario that anybody foresaw Microsoft's reign being upended by a goofy web company.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "So when Google Chrome launched, people wondered how it would survive when websites where being hardcoded against Internet Explorer. Back then websites would straight up tell you they only worked on Internet Explorer. Oh and the enterprise. No system administrator in their right mind would opt for Chrome over IE. After all their \"Enterprise Intranets\" were IE-compatible only.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The conclusion the tech media drew was that while Chrome was fast and well designed IE's mind and market share were impossible to topple. What the tech media and the general public didn't understand was that Google had a more sinister plan with Chrome.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Chrome wasn't made to compete with IE. Chrome was made to make Windows irrelevant. By making Windows irrelevant, Google could wrestle away the influence of Microsoft as the gatekeeper of computing. Every move made by Google and its services was to make Microsoft and its services irrelevant.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "To do that Google would have to come up with strategies to shift the gateway of computing from the lower layer and often proprietary layer of the OS to the open and more accessible layer of the web. Google Chrome became the trojan horse for that strategy.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Gmail launched on April fool's day. It launched on that day because Google, other than being a goofy company, new the reaction it would get. Once again, the shadow of Microsoft's Hotmail loomed over Gmail. Hotmail was again, by far the most dominant email service. So the talk of the media was why anyone needed Gmail, or even the revolutionary and unheard of 1GB of storage that is offered.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Once again, the general public missed the point of Gmail. It wasn't to compete with Hotmail. It was the beginning of the idea that the web could be used for than just rendering static web pages. It was proof that the web could host applications that behaved like rich client applications that ran on your local machine. And those applications could perform better than applications running locally on Windows.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Even though Gmail performed better than every single email client that ran locally on Windows, that didn't stop rich client Email aficionados from endless ruminating over why anyone would choose Gmail over the numerous Email client solutions available for Windows, like Outlook (back then Outlook was Microsoft's native email client for Windows application. \"Enterprise-grade\" stuff. lol). Many of them vowed that their favorite email client would be wrestled out of their dead hands before they used Gmail.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Google Drive and Google Docs (now GSuite) launched to the accustomed ridicule of the press and office productivity snubs. Why on earth would anyone, I say, anyone, put their personal documents in the cloud? \"That is madness,\" the Microsoft Office fanboys pronounced. Everybody knows real work can only be done on a local machine. Even Microsoft ridiculed and mocked the idea. The press praised the realtime collaboration revolution of Google Docs but once again failed to see the point of the product when in their eyes Microsoft Office met the needs of most people. They also questioned the rationality that Google thought anyone would be comfortable putting their documents on the web. You see back then too, the same bullshit arguments we here about the unreliability and unavailability of the Internet persisted.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Android was the punching bag of the tech media when it launched. The fact that Google had the audacity to launch a mobile OS was considered an effrontery to so many people that the tech media collectively decided that for the next 10 years Android would be painted in colors that never measure to iOS and the iPhone. Steve Jobs, the tech media's favorite idol, swore to a thermo-nuclear assault against Android. The tech press, permanently inebriated from Apple's Koolaid, has committed to carrying out his wishes. They use every opportunity to label the platform in a negative light. The narratives you hear about Android to this day is sickening. It is the iPhone for \"poor\" people. It is a \"toxic hell stew.\" And let's not forget the object of ridicule that is the \"green bubble\".\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Once again the public and the press missed the point of Android. Android wasn't created to compete with the iPhone or desecrate Apple. In 2007 the iPhone wasn't the dominant mobile platform. Google bought Android because it feared that Microsoft was going to be as dominant in mobile as it was in the desktop space. Google invested in Android to curtail the influence of Microsoft as the gatekeeper of computing. Google worried that Microsoft's influence on the desktop could easily spill over to mobile. At the time, they had reason to be worried because Windows mobile was almost as dominant as the Blackberry.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "I'm recounting this history to make a point. Today, Google has the most dominant computing platforms on the planet. It's easy for us to forget that at one point products like Android, Chrome, Gmail, Chrome OS, Google Docs, Google Maps, and more were endlessly mocked and considered jokes when they launched.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "We take web applications for granted today, but only a couple of years ago the idea that we'd be working from the cloud much less storing our document on it was unimaginable. The idea that web applications could replace applications running locally on your computer was considered laughable.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Slowly and surely, Google single-handedly made Windows, and OSes in general, irrelevant. Google made the web a universal and open platform for development and computing. We do everything on that matters on the web today. And with the exception of legacy applications, almost every application is a frontend thin client supported by a cloud service.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "The reason Phil Spencer and Microsoft isn't mocking Stadia should now be apparent. Every time Microsoft mocked Google, they ended up eating crow in the most embarrassing manner. It's got to be a hard pill to swallow that Microsoft's latest browser, Edge, runs on Google's browser runtime. This is after years of the Edge team endlessly mocking Chrome. Microsoft has now adopted Open Source when it previously mocked Google for championing it. Microsoft Office now runs in the Cloud, this after the Microsoft fanboys poo-pooed Google Docs. In short, Microsoft has now reinvented itself in the image of Google.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "So to my fellow Stadians, I say to you, RELAX. Stadia is not the first service Google has launched to massive ridicule, mockery, and hate. If you've been around long enough, the arguments against Stadia are all rehashed. When Google has conviction about a product, its eventual dominance is inevitable, for better or worse. I don't know the level of conviction Google has for Stadia, but if it has any at all, all these YouTubers and haters will be eating crow in 10 years. I promise. Microsoft learned this the hard way.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "I mean look at all the love GeForce Now and Xcloud is getting. Just a couple of months ago many gamers didn't even believe that cloud gaming could work. As a matter of act, nobody gave a shit about cloud gaming until Stadia happened. So, Google has already changed the gaming landscape and expectations despite all the \"supposed\" shortcomings of Stadia. Take a look at this Subreddit. It's infiltrated by fanboys and haters from other platforms. If Stadia didn't matter, they wouldn't be here. If Stadia is dead, YouTubers and the media wouldn't be using it to generate views.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "I'm amused at how many YouTubers and haters claim Stadia is dead on arrival, or how everything but the kitchen sink has killed it, yet still, manage to make videos on Stadia every week. I've never seen so much energy wasted on something so dead.",

                message: "What is off about Stadia is honestly the way it was released. With almost all those products you mentioned (Chrome, Gmail, Google Docs, Android etc), Google positioned the product as a small, agile often-Beta product that built a small loyal fanbase and was mostly off the radar of most mainstream users until it decidedly was not.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Stadia on the other hand was launched with a huge amount of pomp and circumstanced, big flashy reels at E3. It felt like a console launch, and it's being treated as one. This goes back to the argument that Stadia should have been released as a beta fanboy product and let grow into a behemoth.\n" +

                    "Perhaps the difference is that without big name games, the platform will never work, and they need to be taken seriously from day 1 to get those games on their platform.

I remember the scramble to get beta invites from people who had Gmail - \"Oh, James has a GMail account? I better hit him up for an invite link!\" Furthermore, they were entirely *free*. Detractors would argue that this made them somewhat anti-competitive, because they were offering for free a comparable (and in many cases, better) product than that others were charging for - I'm looking at you, MS Office, which is now the preserve for businesses or those who need the more refined and advanced functions of Excel, and not 'literally everyone who has to write anything, ever'.

Within a few months, a handful of competing products have been released that are superior in various ways even if they're also inferior in others. This didn't happen with GMail or GDocs or the like. I'm a huge Google fan - my email is GMail, my online storage is Drive, I've had an Android phone solidly since 2009, I have a Chromebook etc - but I've not tried Stadia and I have tried GeForce now. Why? Because I can't try Stadia without spending over a hundred smackeroos, I can try GeForce now entirely for free. For me, it works really, really well (technically, I mean). All the things I thought would be pitfalls with Stadia when it was first announced have turned out to be great, and all the things I thought they'd have sewn up have turned out to be the things they've screwed the pooch on.\n" +

No one makes games for a platform with no players, and no players join a platform with no games. Even Nintendo, with it's enormous stable of quality first-party properties, suffered from this with the WiiU. The Buy In with Stadia is much less than with a console, and soon it'll be practically nil when the free, base tier releases. But for those people - like me - for whom GeForce now works extremely well, what incentive do I have to buy a game on Stadia rather than Steam? It'll have a lower user count, costs more per month, so far the games look worse and the games themselves cost more. Should any of these factors change for a specific game, I can buy just that one game on Stadia, then go back to using GeForce for everything else. For the other cloud platforms, this arrangement would be fine. For Stadia, which *needs* players to build its platform so that developers can justify porting games to it, I don't think this is enough.",
