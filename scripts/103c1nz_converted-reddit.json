        "message": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bacteria cell consists of many different parts, but the relevant one here is called the &amp;quot;Bi-Lipid Layer&amp;quot;, which is a layer of lipids that enclose the cell and essentially function as its skin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lipids are a group of compounds that include organic fats, oils, and waxes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, most things are either hydrophobic (fat/oil soluble, but not water soluble) or hydrophillic (water soluble but not lipid soluble).  Things are usually one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Detergents are somewhat unique in the fact that they are both hydrophillic &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; hydrophobic - they bind to both oil and water, and allow them to be bonded together in very close proximity, where they would usually very strongly repel each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, you have a bacteria with its lipidous cell wall, immersed in water.  The water is normally repelled by this layer, preventing the bacteria from dissolving into it.\nEnter a molecule of detergent.  This molecule bonds strongly to the bacteria&amp;#39;s protective lipid layer.  This causes a very strong attraction to the surrounding water, while adjacent lipid molecules, which are not bonded to detergent, strongly repel the water.  This bonding and attraction between a water molecule and the lipid molecule is now so strong that the bacterial cell wall rips and ruptures apart, thereby spilling its innards and killing the cell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: a commenter corrected my phrasing - the terminology is lipid bilayer, not bi-lipid layer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Detergents cannot be applied internally - see the next part of my response for why.\nWith that said, regular hand-washing is one of the most effective disease-control measures we have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, detergent absolutely does have this effect on human tissue.  Your skin cells in particular have evolved to be quite resilient, but detergent can and does kill them - fortunately your skin is made of many layers of cells, so damage is not immediately evident.  Your skin also secretes oils to keep it soft and protected, and these oils use up a good amount of detergent before it can get to the cells themselves.&lt;br/&gt;\nBut wash your hands with strong dish soap many times a day, and after a few days you&amp;#39;ll develop irritated, dry, cracking skin, with bleeding sores.\nThis is also why the whole tide-pod thing was so dangerous - your internal tissue has not developed the same resilience as your skin has, and eating high-strength detergents can cause &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; damage to your digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, how can bacteria live on soap?\nPartly because of the reasons I mentioned in the previous paragraph, most body soaps have been developed to not so much kill bacteria and other cells, as dislodge them and allow them to be washed away.  This causes minimal damage to your skin, but still cleans it - the bacteria have been washed off, rather than killed.\nFurthermore, those soaps and detergents that ARE lethal to cells (like dish soap) are only effective in the presence of water.  See my original comment for more info there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "message": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sponge is definitely carrying bacteria from dish one to dish two. But the soap + scrubbing is making the mechanical removal of food and bacteria much easier. Basically freeing it from adhesion to the surface of the dishes so that the final rinsing with water carries the bulk of it away and down the drain. I personally think sponges are gross and not good for cleaning things involved with eating. They harbor bacteria like it’s nobody’s business and you’re right to be questioning this. I’d recommend switching to a plastic bristled brush that you can fully rinse off between dishes and apply fresh squirts of dish soap to for each dish.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
