    "message": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work in a field where drug tests may happen. I’m a union construction worker. Before working on a school, hospital, college, usually, a pre-employment drug test takes place.  Now, I may have not consumed marijuana for a week. There’s a decent chance that it’ll still show up on a piss test. I believe this is unfair, especially in my state of Massachusetts, where it’s 100% legal for adults 21+. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These “5 panel drug tests” are in reality, weed tests. Cocaine, Meth, opiates, PCP, are all out of your system within days. So, you get called on a Friday for work on Monday. You can party hard Friday, and the cocaine is very likely to be undetectable come Monday’s drug test. But marijuana? Unlikely it will be undetectable. These drug tests are in reality checking for marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can drink alcohol 6 hours before work and no one bats an eye, but smoke one joint 4 days before work and suddenly, you’re out of a job. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think it’s very unfair and jobs should no longer test for marijuana. Especially where it’s 100% legal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there’s injuries. If I get injured on a job, I’m automatically subject to a drug test. So, I fall off a ladder, and the joint I smoked last night will screw me out of workmen’s comp or possibly a lawsuit. But if I drank alcohol the night before, there’s no way to tell, and nobody cares. Very much a double standard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do believe this will change in the future, but it should change ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                "message": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of it is wrapped up in costs of insurance and their own liability. First, no company will be willing to absorb the liability of a workers substance use. As you have said, these tests cannot distinguish a joint smoked last week from one smoked this morning. But, in the wake of a wrongful death suit the company would share a huge proportion of liability if, for instance, the crane operator peed hot after swinging a load into somebody. The companies, justifiably, don’t want to accept this liability. Another thing worth considering is insurance costs. Insurance can require that employees are drug tested, and it can become prohibitively expensive not to do so. I worked offshore in the oilfield for a contractor that did work for major oil companies; our contractor drug tested because our bigwig clients like Shell, BP, and all them required it. Our company wouldn’t have won any of their bids if they didn’t…construction is a competitive market, and forgetting legal marijuana, safety is key to running business. When my grandpa first started drug testing at his contact or back in like the 80’s, he additionally noted a marked decrease in both worker theft and absenteeism. It seems that for construction companies, drug use (including legal marijuana use) makes it all around more costly for the company to do business. Why should a company keep the employees that make business unnecessarily costly? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Find a job that doesn’t drug test” is absolutely a valid suggestion. Now, if building public infrastructure and operating heavy machinery is kinda your thing, then “don’t use drugs” is valid, as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

There are no protections for &amp;quot;substance abuse&amp;quot; job requirements, even of legal substances.  What you&amp;#39;re asking for would be an exception &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; Marijuana to give it priority status over legal substances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand the part where Marijuana staying in your system so long is inconvenient, but that seems an odd reason to create another test for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s put it this way.  Diagnostic Centers have (and are willing to perform) Caffeine tests.  If a crazy company wants to test you for Caffeine and will refuse you employment over it, they actually have every right to do that.  Just because nobody does it doesn&amp;#39;t mean they can&amp;#39;t.  They can test for Salvia in your urine as well even though it is completely legal in most states AND federally legal.  Same deal, you can be terminated for having Salvia in your urine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what you&amp;#39;re asking for is either special treatment for Marijuana OR a change that amounts to making drug use a Protected Status for employee termination.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real issue, perhaps, is the continued unreasonable stigma around pot.  None of that would matter if nobody WANTED to test for it.  But there are companies that do, and it&amp;#39;s their prerogative if you choose to work for them and sign off on a drug test.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or issue/solution #2.  It seems silly that forcing consent to invasive medical testing is legal at all.  But we live in a business-friendly country, so that&amp;#39;s not changing any time soon.  Especially in the wake of the various legal precedents around Wellness Initiatives that said you can be terminated over mandatory blood-tests and mandated health maintenance plans.  Overweight? They can force you into a weight-loss bracket.  Smoker? They can force you into a smoke-cessation program.  What is a pee test for marijuana when compared to that, legally speaking?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Federal law supersedes state law. That&amp;#39;s in the constitution, article VI, Paragraph 2&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That the federal government has taken a lax standpoint on it doesn&amp;#39;t change that the federal government very much treats it as illegal for it&amp;#39;s contractors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Safety reasons doesn’t hold, as it will detect marijuana I smoked 10 hours ago… doesn’t mean I’m under the influence on the clock&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This point is less solid than you make it out to be. People can have significant side effects the following day and can actually be found to be more cognitively impaired than chronic alcohol users. Though on that your mileage may vary. Also you can test for alcohol in the same way that you can test for marijuana (i.e. with a test that will detect any use within a few weeks.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I agree with your point that it&amp;#39;s hypocritical for marijuana to be illegal while alcohol is legal. But it is a standard that the government has set and as such it&amp;#39;s not unreasonable for an employer to include it on a panel of drugs being tested to protect themselves from liability. No one needs pot to live and if your job drug tests you and is up front with that it&amp;#39;s your choice to work for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The point is they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;testing&amp;quot; for basically only marijuana, a far, far less debilitating drug than any of the other ones that are the actual reason for these policies in the first place. I mean, I guess you could argue there is a deterrence factor for employees to not show up with meth or heroin or coke literally in their system because they just used? But that&amp;#39;s still no excuse to keep testing for marijuana if all it&amp;#39;s going to tell you is whether someone has used a legal drug anytime recently regardless of whether that use has any relevance to anything anymore. Particularly since within the last 10-15 years there are now thousands and thousands of people like me who are using cannabis for no other reason than that our doctor prescribed it and it&amp;#39;s helping us live better lives, including being better employees. Perhaps I am and should be unemployable in your eyes because I developed chronic migraines in my 30s through no fault of my own, and cannabis is far less intoxicating and inhibiting on me than the other preventatives and interventionary drugs my neurologists experimented with on me for several years. Fortunately I had long gotten through school and established myself in a white collar career where drinking and drugs are so common that the last thing someone like me needs to worry about is losing business, my job, or the respect of the people around me in my life simply because I&amp;#39;m smoking weed or eating an edible sometimes while reviewing their reports or something. But it just breaks my heart how even such smart people as frequenting this sub, are so conditioned to think if someone is doing something &amp;quot;naughty&amp;quot; then it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if they&amp;#39;re being egregiously unfairly treated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you (and I don&amp;#39;t mean you personally, since this wasn&amp;#39;t an argument you were making) have a 1950&amp;#39;s level understanding of drug abuse, addiction, and marijuana and you think someone who was hungover at work from drugs or alcohol and who gets injured in an accident deserves to be treated like a total piece of shit who deserves no help or compassion, the current system doesn&amp;#39;t accomplish that unless the person also happens to be a weed smoker. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out of shear curiosity I would love to see how much more vehement agreement there would be with OP if, for some reason, alcohol was detectable in people&amp;#39;s systems for 30-60 days within use, and people were getting fired and unhired in the first place because they had a few glasses of wine three weekends ago and a few beers watching football in the meantime. &amp;quot;Bbbbbbbut thems the rules and will always be the rules, bud,&amp;quot; would not be posted over and over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Why they set those reasons will vary based on the occupation. OP states they only test for Marijuana, but unfortunately, they test for everything. A employer has no choice but to protect themselves based on what their insurer asks for, as well as how they can be held legally liable in a workplace incident. Do I believe they use these tests as a deterrent? Maybe? Now you stating something being legal or prescribed, does not mean it is considered safe to be on during certain situations. There are warnings on many prescriptions not to drive or operate heavy machinery. I have personally declined prescriptions in the past that would impair my ability to drive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you wrote this response, you made a lot of assumptions about how I feel about the subject. I do not believe you or OP should be unable to earn a living. Believe it or not, I fully support legalization. I personally believe that everything in the United States is over regulated.  But that wasn&amp;#39;t the question. We as a society are litigious. And until that changes, this is the system in place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And just like some jobs test hair for drugs, alcohol can be found in the hair for up to 90 days. And some companies will test for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

We don’t have another way to know if you were smoking a joint right before you jumped on the forklift and hit someone vs. if you did it the night before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People who smoke weed can easily inform themselves of this. They choose to take this risk if they want to enter a line of work that involves (comparatively) a high amount of injuries and deaths. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why would a company not want to prevent this? They honestly do not care if you did smoke weed the night before they aren’t choosing a test like that on purpose or because they don’t like a stoner lifestyle. They chooss the test because it is the only avaliable, they choose it because being inebrated may cause injurys and deaths of other workers that they should not be lilable for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

That&amp;#39;s kind of the point. Marijuana use is still heavily stigmatized despite being legal in many areas. All while heavy alcohol use is not. I&amp;#39;d rather someone come to work after they used marijuana a couple of days before than someone who comes to work really hungover from the night before.  But only one of those people is going to test positive on a drug screen and it&amp;#39;s not the person who is actually impaired. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Random drug testing is dont to prevent those accidents in the first place. To stop you coming to work on coke for ex. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you think people who don&amp;#39;t have the self-control not to come to work high because it&amp;#39;s dangerous, will not come to work high because of random drug tests? Somehow I doubt that. There&amp;#39;s also no random blood alcohol testing, a far more widely used and equally dangerous drug.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would say all random drug tests do is encourage people to use possibly more dangerous drugs that don&amp;#39;t appear on regular urine drug screens. Or they punish otherwise fine employees who use marijuana in their off hours. It&amp;#39;s one thing to test if there&amp;#39;s a suspicion of being impaired at work, but random drug testing is generally unfair and can lead to people&amp;#39;s termination for no good reason. There&amp;#39;s also the risk of false positives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edited to add&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things like CBD can also make you test positive (which many people don&amp;#39;t realize) for marijuana, even products marked &amp;quot;no THC.&amp;quot; Imagine losing your job because you took a CBD gummy to help you sleep. And you can&amp;#39;t even argue CBD is federally illegal because it isn&amp;#39;t. Random drug testing hurts far more people than it possibly protects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

People can drink a fair bit and then feel perfectly fine the next mornih but they still blow just over (or it hasn’t reduced to 0 just yet).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "message": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can drink alcohol 6 hours before work and no one bats an eye&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, this isn&amp;#39;t true. If the alcohol is still in your system, and it comes out in a drug screening, it can cause you to fail the test. And especially for jobs involving heavy equipment and / or operating a vehicle, testing positive for alcohol in a drug test will cause you to fail the test.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rightfully so, since alcohol in your system means you&amp;#39;re still being affected on some level.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with weed is that it can be difficult for most test to distinguish between recent use and the sort of residual presence that could still be there a week later. This is also one of the big reasons why there&amp;#39;s such an issue with pot legality in general. The means to test for its active presence in DUI situations still leaves a lot to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The big problem is that weed is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; universally legal in the US, but varies in its legality from state to state &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; is still illegal federally. That means that companies are within their rights-- even in a state where it&amp;#39;s legal-- to deny employment based on weed use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What needs to happen is two things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) a test needs to be developed that&amp;#39;s capable of identifying when someone is actually under the influence of weed, and after that&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) the federal prohibition against weed needs to end&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But until #1 happens, I&amp;#39;m okay with it being illegal. Just as with alcohol, we need to be able to reliably prohibit people from casual use in situations that could endanger other people or themselves. As it stands, I live in an area where weed is easy to acquire, and I smell it coming out of cars all the time. Sorry, but I&amp;#39;m not okay with that. Regardless of what some potheads say, weed &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; cause changes in perception that can negatively affect reaction time, decision making, and judgment, and those are things that shouldn&amp;#39;t be influenced when someone is driving a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

                    "message": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry bro, you seem a little too stupid to be here. You see, that motorcycle you&amp;#39;re driving around tells us you&amp;#39;re too stupid to adequately assess risks for someone with your cognitive abilities. Maybe you only drive it for short trips in perfect weather during the day twice a year, but for all we know you&amp;#39;re joyriding on that thing without a helmet 24/7 and even faster in the rain and snow, so we think you&amp;#39;re too stupid to work here. You&amp;#39;re cool with this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And would you be perfectly fine with the system in place if alcohol happened to be detectable 30-60 days after use and was being used to discriminate against people who got drunk at a wedding three weeks ago or had a couple beers at a cookout over the weekend?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all, if you think posting links about possible indications that weed impacts you weeks after you smoked it, do you how much more conclusive evidence there is that alcohol, a far more widely abused drug, has long lasting effects? How do you feel about functional alcoholics getting loaded after work every day? Have you been losing sleep over it or do you not particularly care since it hasn&amp;#39;t been a Rule so it&amp;#39;s off your radar, just like it would be if drug tests stopped including weed because it&amp;#39;s impossible to know how recently someone has even used it, let alone still impaired?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This wonderful system you all are so eagerly stanning for doesn&amp;#39;t even protect businesses from the heaviest drug users or people with the cognitive problems that functional alcoholics have. It&amp;#39;s not even busting people for abusing far and away the most abused substance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lmfao. If alcohol were treated the same way as weed for employment purposes, unemployed people would be rioting in the streets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For some reason you people think the burden should be on OP or weed users to put together a truly air tight case for why the rules should be changed so they&amp;#39;re no longer being so unfairly discriminated against due to an accidental foible of the testing process. Why isn&amp;#39;t your starting point more like: what&amp;#39;s the best case for discriminating so prejudicially against weed smokers of all people using substances?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To use the topic of the interview/background check process, would you not see any problems with a system that, for whatever reason, could only identify if someone has stolen from their previous employers in the last month, but if someone has ever told a lie at work in the last two years, then they don&amp;#39;t get the job either? In this situation, would you at least be able to intellectually appreciate that the system itself might be unfair, even if there are good reasons to want to know if someone is a pathological liar or thief? If the process of weeding out bad potential employees is treating everyone who&amp;#39;s ever told a white lie the same as everyone who literally just stole from their employer, would you really be dumbfounded if the system were being criticized for reasons of unfairness? I mean, it&amp;#39;s not even catching people who are chronic thiefs, so long as they haven&amp;#39;t done it the last month. Nor is it making any distinction  between someone who lied to a coworker they knew was getting fired, vs a sociopath who is going to be getting high on their lies all day everyday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And none of this is even to get into the difference between someone potentially being the victim of a disease vs someone being a thief or liar. If anything, my analogy isn&amp;#39;t even doing justice to much of the injustice with the current drug testing for employment system. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nor is it broaching on the ridiculous issue that there are people like me who use cannabis for no other reason than they it was prescribed to us by our doctors to treat debilitating conditions that by no means make us otherwise unemployable. Only the thing that helps my chronic migraines with far fewer side effects or hangover than other intervention my neurologists tried is the reason I am unemployable in your eyes and the eyes of so many people. Fortunately my condition didn&amp;#39;t arise until I was already through school and established a career in real estate where nobody gives a fuck who&amp;#39;s drunk, high, or medicinally using cannabis. I feel so bad for younger folks or who otherwise are not fortunate enough to work for themselves or employers who aren&amp;#39;t going to gain from a pathetic drug screening system that treats every failed result the same, no matter how indefensibly stupid that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: all kinds of typos when I&amp;#39;m on my phone. Sorry for what I&amp;#39;m sure are many others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Marijuana is only very mildly physically addictive, with withdrawal symptoms limited to mostly insomnia and irritability for a couple of weeks for a very, very heavy smoker. Conversely, alcohol addiction can become so severe that withdrawal can outright kill an extreme drinker who quits cold turkey; there is a reason that there are alcohol IVs in hospitals, and none for even the infamously addictive heroin! I knew someone a number of years ago who was having issues assumed to be caused by a concussion. He was taken to the hospital after he was found talking to his door, as he thought it was a cop, and it turned out that he was suffering from severe alcohol withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Those projects by and large involve working in and around people/children who would be less likely to be capable of saving themselves from danger if you made a mistake due to residual drug effects. It takes marijuana much longer to metabolize out of your system, which means by its very nature you are unable to claim you are 100% &amp;quot;sober&amp;quot; (even if you aren&amp;#39;t feeling any effects anymore), so insurance companies won&amp;#39;t cover any accidents in which the person who caused the accident doesn&amp;#39;t present a clear drug panel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Case in point: an accident occurred on one such job site in Ontario where someone driving a mini-crane carrying a slab of granite accidently dropped it on another worker, killing him instantly. Despite the fact that safe practice dictates for this very reason that no one walk beneath a hanging slab (so by that logic the worker who died was &amp;quot;at fault&amp;quot;), the driver of the mini-crane was tested and it came out that he had been drinking and smoking weed the night before. The legal argument is made that having even small residual amounts of drugs in your system could have SOME effect on your reaction time/decision-making abilities, and that split-second difference COULD be the difference between life and death. In this case, the burden would be on you to prove that there&amp;#39;s ZERO chance that the residual drugs effected the driver&amp;#39;s abilities, and there just isn&amp;#39;t a way to prove that. Hence, zero tolerance policies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect the marijuana-vs-other drugs issue will change over time when more studies are done that can indiscriminately prove the effects are gone within however many hours/days. But until such a time, those tests are there for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

However, as someone who works in a technical capacity (not patient-facing) and takes long breaks from cannabis from time to time, I can tell you that having THC in your system absolutely impairs you beyond the acute phase of intoxication.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now. It isn’t a night-and-day thing. You can definitely function at a high level with THC in your system. But when it comes to certain professions (pilot, surgeon, etc), I don’t want to take even a 5-10% reduction in cognitive ability, because when the shit hits the fan, you’ll need all your faculties. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; agree with you is the general drug screening for regular-ass jobs. Cashiers, accountants, etc etc. No reason to discriminate against cannabis users there. But for professions involving safety hazards… yeah I’m ok with it. And say this as someone who has smoked &lt;em&gt;acres&lt;/em&gt; of the stuff in my time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

And at the 24 hour point, &amp;quot;only one reported any awareness of the drug&amp;#39;s effects.&amp;quot; So your performance could be negatively affected without you even realising it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So before we allow a free-for-all when it comes to weed and work (and also things like driving), I would like to have more accurate tests, and if possible, a way to prevent the effects of weed to last past, say, 12 hours. Or make it more obvious to the imbiber that they&amp;#39;re still affected if they are. I don&amp;#39;t know if this is possible, but until it is, as annoying as it may seem, I think drug testing should still include THC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The one area I would be prepared to compromise on is pre-employment, or at least, on the presence of THC in a pre-employment test being an automatic rejection. If someone meets your criteria to work at certain jobs (where no lives are on the line) while testing positive for THC, then maybe they should still be allowed to do the job. But of course, there&amp;#39;s liability and insurance issues, which mean it&amp;#39;s currently easier to reject applicants who test positive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

The issue is not that marijuana sticks around for longer than other drug metabolites, the issue is that our drug tests are flawed in the context of employment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Put simply, recreational drug taking in and of itself is a matter between an individual and law enforcement. If an employee is convicted of a drug related crime then an employer should be free to fire them, but we don&amp;#39;t allow vigilante justice and firing people for the suspicion of crimes (or at least we shouldn&amp;#39;t). A drug screen cannot possibly demonstrate that a law has been broken; the person might use prescribed marijuana or have been injected with cocaine as a local anaesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where drug use is the concern of an employer is where it leads to impairment of the employee&amp;#39;s ability to do their job. This is of course grounds for disciplinary action or even firing. However at present with the exception of alcohol we have no tests for drug-induced impairment. It is thus impossible to say whether a positive test for drugs has resulted in impairment of the worker during work time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the impairment itself is the issue, and that can be grounds for disciplinary action without any need for a drugs test. Someone who comes into work excessively tired and falls asleep or makes lots of errors would be reprimanded or fired, and they would of course pass a drugs test. Does that logic make sense?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a different note, I also believe that the benefits of routing drug screening are negligible in terms of improving workplace safety, as demonstrated by the lack of excess problems in places where such screening is illegal. However the damage is high: screening can be used as an excuse for not hiring people, and it is open to significant opportunity to discriminate against those on prescription medication who may well be protected as disabled but will in practice struggle to fight against a failed drugs test.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does my argument persuade you at all?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "message": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically in most states that allow legal marijuana use,   a law was voted on that makes it legal. Just because something is legal doesn’t make it a right, employers are only required to avoid violating your rights. If you were to get hammered drunk right before work and come in to work, you would probably be fired unless that is something your job allows (unlikely but I am sure somewhere out there that job exists). It’s not illegal to get drunk but it isn’t your right to be drunk whenever you please. Missouri just voted on a constitutional amendment which includes the ability to purchase and use marijuana in the state constitution, this technically makes the use of marijuana a right for citizens 21+ and it’s been met with a lot of resistance due to the potential impact it could have on the ability for parol officers to test for marijuana in parolees as part of the terms of their release. Same concerns had by employers. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, while I agree it is annoying to potentially lose a job over something you did a week ago, private companies can dictate who they do/do not want to employee as long as it is not for a protected reason or infringing on the individuals rights. Unless marijuana use is determined to be a right by, I assume, the Supreme Court, companies will and should be able to test for the substance if they feel it necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

While it&amp;#39;s true that marijuana can stay in a person&amp;#39;s system for a longer period of time compared to other substances, it&amp;#39;s important to consider the reasons why pre-employment drug testing, including for marijuana, is often conducted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the construction field, for example, safety is a top priority. Impairment from drugs or alcohol can significantly increase the risk of accidents and injuries on the job. Employers have a responsibility to ensure that their workers are able to perform their duties safely and effectively, and pre-employment drug testing can help to identify potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it&amp;#39;s important to remember that not all states have legalized marijuana for recreational use. In states where it is still illegal, pre-employment drug testing for marijuana is necessary to ensure compliance with the law.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That being said, I understand the concerns you&amp;#39;ve raised about the potential for marijuana to remain detectable in a person&amp;#39;s system for a longer period of time compared to other substances. It&amp;#39;s possible that as attitudes and laws surrounding marijuana continue to evolve, we may see changes to the way it is tested for in pre-employment drug screens.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Not because they care whether you smoke a joint when you get home after work, they probably don&amp;#39;t.

If you break the law, that probably means you are not going to be a great employee, but that is hardly the only factor they consider.

If you smoke once a month I couldn&amp;#39;t care less.

It&amp;#39;s still oversimplified (I could explain why of you&amp;#39;re interested) but it&amp;#39;s true pot impairs your ability to perform most jobs. Nobody (including OP) is disputing that employers are justified in barring their employees from being high at work. Of course I wouldn&amp;#39;t want my pilot high, just like I wouldn&amp;#39;t want them drunk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But there is not evidence that using pot permanently reduces your intelligence after you sober up, especially for adults using it sporadically. And anecdotally, I know plenty of ivy league grad students and people making six figures with important responsibilities who use marijuana.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The trouble with your mindset is that it makes no distinction between a &amp;quot;chronic pothead&amp;quot; who&amp;#39;s constantly high and the millions of Americans who use pot sparingly and responsibly - for example, only on weekends. It&amp;#39;s like saying anyone who drinks any alcohol is an alcoholic, and then pointing to the handful of alcoholics you&amp;#39;ve met in your life as proof you can&amp;#39;t succeed in life if you drink beer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In both cases, you&amp;#39;re overgeneralizing from extreme anecdotes. You absolutely do not have to choose one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, pot can have some weak effects the next morning - but they&amp;#39;re not the psychoactive effects or troublesome loss of motor skills. It&amp;#39;s more of a brain fog, again comparable to the hangover you might have after a night on the town.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no good reason why the law or employers should treat marijuana any differently than alcohol. In both cases it can be abused, but can also be enjoyed responsibly outside work hours by highly driven, productive, disciplined people. The problem is that government and bosses treat this behavior asymmetrically. The breathalizer tests if you&amp;#39;re drunk &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, which is obviously bad. But the piss test only says whether you&amp;#39;ve had any pot at any time in the past month; almost everyone who fails it is NOT because they showed up to work high. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I knew my pilot smoked a week ago but is sober as a judge now, I would not have any apprehensions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It is decriminalized. These are different things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decriminalization means that the state will not prosecute some local-level crimes associated with the drug and that they may have even passed local laws making it legal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the federal laws, which apply to all of the USA still have marijuana as a schedule 1 drug, making it illegal to possess or use for any purpose without significant federal approvals.  The governing law is the Controlled Substance Act (Public Law 91-513).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12270\"&gt;This document&lt;/a&gt; from the Congressional Research Center explains this issue in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We live in a Republic. What is legal is dependent upon all of the entities involved. The hierarchy is &amp;quot;Treaties/Constitution -&amp;gt; Federal Laws -&amp;gt; State Laws -&amp;gt; County Laws -&amp;gt; City/Local Laws&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the higher-level laws apply in the jurisdiction of lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, a town may not have passed any speed limit laws locally. However, if county law dictates maximum speeds allowed on residential streets, then the town still has speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

There&amp;#39;s a few things that are looked at, first was training and engineering sufficient to prevent the accident.  Second was the employee negligent in any way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first part is obvious, and there&amp;#39;s rules that the employer has to follow.  But the second part?  You can be found liable, even if partially.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I go out on a bender all weekend drinking (a 100% legal drug) and come into work severely dehydrated and fall into an unguarded meat chopper, well OSHA will come in and say &amp;quot;50/50 negligence.  The shop should have had guards in place (engineering solution) and the employee was negligent for a history of substance abuse that affected workplace judgement&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;particularly if he was trained on how to use the guards properly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Was the employee trained?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is one of the first and most important question asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like weed.  I&amp;#39;ve partook for nearly 35 years now.  But when I&amp;#39;m going to be in an environment where drug testing can occur, I absolutely don&amp;#39;t indulge.
