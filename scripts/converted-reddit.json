        "message": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA, when left untreated, can increase the pressures in the right side of your heart. Most people are familiar with high blood pressure and controlling your blood pressure which is most commonly linked to the left side of your heart. But there’s also pressure within the pulmonary vasculature. The right side of the heart is not as Muscular as the left side, as the left side clearly has to pump blood throughout the entire body. When our airway is occluded, such as with sleep apnea over a long period of time, the right side of the heart increases the amount of work it has to do to pump the blood through the lungs. When your brain has a drop in oxygen, which occurs with OSA, the body believes it is lacking oxygen, and so it makes the right side of the heart pump harder to push blood to the lungs to get oxygen, and then return the blood left side of the heart and pump it to the rest of the body, including the brain. The pressure within the pulmonary system normally is less than 30 whereas most people are familiar with having a low blood pressure of 120/80, so you can see that the normal pressure within the pulmonary system is much much lower than that of the systemic blood pressure normally used to hearing about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the right side of the heart continues to work hard, just like any muscle, it increases in size causing an increase in your pulmonary artery pressure, causing pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to shortness of breath, debility, dyspnea with exertion, lower extremity swelling (just to name a few). These things can lead to a decrease in your overall activity level, which could then lead to a more sedentary lifestyle, which has an effect on the longevity and quality of life in an individual. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Heart failure, regardless if it’s left side or right side, is a chronic condition. A serious form of heart failure is called cor pulmonale. This is when the right side of the heart fails and can cause severe issues, including the collapse of the left ventricle if the right ventricle becomes too large. If the left ventricle collapses then it makes it almost impossible for the left side to pump blood throughout the rest of the body leading to very critical conditions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps, there are many benefits of utilizing CPAP or BiPAP therapy if you have a obstructive sleep apnea. If you or your loved ones, believe they have obstructive sleep apnea, it is advised to talk to your primary care physician, or general practitioner going forward..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "message": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your breathing is literally vital. You need oxygen in constant and consistent supply to ensure your cells have the fuel they need to continue what they&amp;#39;re doing moment to moment. You also need to dispose of CO2 to maintain good pH balance in your blood. When you aren&amp;#39;t doing that, you&amp;#39;re body as a whole tries to take drastic action to preserve oxygen supply, which is good when used short term, but very bad of used chronically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;#39;s say you have sleep apnea. And at night, you stop breathing. You don&amp;#39;t notice consciously, because you&amp;#39;re asleep. But you have receptors in your vessels that do notice the change in pH that has occurred because there is more acidic CO2 in your blood now. The body tried to compensate by increasing pulse and blood pressure, to try to force the blood to go around faster and into the tissues more to offload more oxygen. But there&amp;#39;s not much to go around. Your body also starts spiking your cortisol to try to wake you up because this is serious. And so you kind of do wake up long enough to start to breathe normally, then fall back to sleep and the cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you stop breathing once and have this response once, that&amp;#39;s ok. But if you&amp;#39;re constantly doing this overnight, you&amp;#39;re not sleeping right, which is bad for you functioning and it&amp;#39;s bad for your brain health. Your heart and blood vessels are progressively stained by this, and they are also deprived of oxygen. We don&amp;#39;t fully understand all the pathways that produce harm from sleep apnea, but it does follow that chronic deprivation of oxygen is going to harm your normal function in a variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does that make sense? If not I can try to explain better&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It is essentially when your brain forgets to tell you body to inhale while you sleep. It can be associated with things like heart failure, arrhythmias but in my experience it is usually due to one of 2 underlying problems. 1-A neurodegenerative condition (think things like MS, ALS, or most recently a chap with Charcot Marie Tooth syndrome), or 2-due to medications such as opioids or more commonly patients on methadone based use disorder treatment. There’s also an interesting association with HIV infection too. But I’ve noticed with the advent of excellent anti-retrovirals I’ve seen less and less discussion of this in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OSA is much more common, one could argue it is present in epidemic proportions. In this case the pro/nasopharyngeal soft tissue is hypertrophied and as we sleep lying on our backs that tissue relaxes because its full of smother muscle fibers and everything falls backwards blocking the airway. Oxygen actually tends to stay normal for quite a while before it starts dropping off (low O2 sats), but what goes up is your CO2 and this is what your brains notices and disturbs your sleep (Interestingly this is the circuit that is faulty in CSA). Back to the closed airway…when this happens your lung muscles wil continue to try and push air out this increases the pressure in the thoracic cavity which in turn compresses the Vena cava (return route to the heart) this reduces the ability of the heart to “prime” its pumping mechanism thus reducing its output and the resultant low Oxygen. Now to compensate the heart like any other muscle will get stranger (Hypertrophied), this is pathological because while it might maintain things while your asleep when you wake up that extra push on the pump is still present so your BP goes up (hypertension) and because of the thick walls of the heart it becomes less and less efficient (Heart failure) these increase the risk of MI and stoke and thus OSA is a major risk factor for them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Treatment is similar for both, we have to constantly push air into the airway so it stays open (CPAP) there are variations but that’s the basics of treatment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this is the important bit…when I talk to my patients about this they are understandably not excited about sleeping attached to a machine. I explain to them that there are 2 perspectives; for me I want to treat it because I know if I can control it I can prevent or delay cardiovascular disease, for them though I explain they should feel less fatigued, wake up with less headaches, have less depression, and more energy. When we get the setup right patients invariably fell much better. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tidbits: If you have OSA take an old t-shirt and sew a tennis ball into the front and back, this will stop you sleeping on your front or back, OSA is reduced by 20-30% in side sleepers. Some of us are very excited about the massive uptick in interest in obesity medications especially ozempic (semalglutide), right now due to our wonderful payer system its out of reach for a lot of people but as it becomes more available and we treat obesity more effectively we should see a resultant reduction in OSA syndromes. But that will take years for us to be able to make that connection through research studies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry to prattle on I love explaining things like this to my patients&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: words and spelling&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT 2: WOW I was not expecting so many responses thanks to all who asked great questions, remember speak to your PCPs, bring a list, and if you need to bring a friend as an advocate.\nI’ve gotta go do some non-doctor stuff like shopping and stuff so I’ll check back later&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Last month was his 2nd month in a row without missing a star! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He went from being a generally non verbal, constantly sleeping and lethargic, as well as severe constipation, to being a cheerful, happy, expressive guy. He’ll never have full conversational skills due to his low IQ and schizophrenia, but he went from struggling to form single words and needing 5-10 seconds to respond in any fashion, to now being able to talk on the phone with his sister and process what’s happening, and responding in real time. He doesn’t know how to hide his emotions or feelings, really at all, so it’s very straightforward. He will literally outright tell you with a big hearty smile that he is “Happy today!” It makes me feel so good knowing that I was able to help him figure out something that had truly been a serious detriment on his quality of life. He understands now that he’s not capable of taking care of himself all on his own, and has given me a lot of trust because of this CPAP machine. It’s one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

You have to create and secrete a lot of adrenaline to keep you from suffocating at night, etc etc. Its just generally taxing on your body&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "message": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The premise of this question is wrong. CPAP does not increase the lifespan of users by 7 years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RCTs show much, much more modest benefits and have not shown any mortality benefit. (Sidebar: I would wager there is, in fact, a mortality benefit in some subgroups of patients for whom equipoise no longer exists and thus it can’t be studied by RCT). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Observational studies show effects that large because users of CPAP are very different from non-users in a variety of ways (health behaviors, socioeconomic status, etc) and it is very hard to adequately control for those differences. This is called ‘healthy adherer bias’.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

CPAP does not come even close to normalizing sleep, and people who keep using it are usually lighter cases in the first place, with regard to nasal breathing especially.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quoting &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6825873/\"&gt;this commentary on a similar paper to the one you linked&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, in an RCT of candesartan or placebo for heart failure patients, high adherence to candesartan was associated with a 35% reduction in risk of death compared to those with low adherence to candesartan [2]. On the surface, such data would suggest a dose-response relationship between candesartan and its clinical benefit. &lt;strong&gt;However, when the same analytic approach was applied to those assigned to the placebo arm, the risk of death was again much lower in those with high adherence to placebo. In fact, high adherence to placebo had a several-fold larger effect size on reduced mortality than candesartan itself.&lt;/strong&gt; Given the lack of biologic plausibility that placebo reduces the risk of death in heart failure, the more likely explanation is that those who adhere to study drug (whether candesartan or placebo) have other healthy behaviors, socioeconomic factors, or other unmeasurable confounders that affect outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "message": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea can also cause numerous other sleep disorders known as parasomnia. I tried CPAP and an oral appliance and neither were working, so I just had surgery for my sleep apnea (UPPP, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, and uvulectomy. It was causing sleep walking, sleep talking, sleep eating , non-rem sleep arousal (sexsomnia), restless leg syndrome, and restless limb movement disorder. These, in turn, raise your risk of developing Parkinson&amp;#39;s and other degenerative disorders. From what I remember, your body uses spinal fluid to flush toxins from your brain when you sleep, and if you are not getting good sleep then this will not happen as it should and your brain will age or decline faster than it otherwise would have.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
