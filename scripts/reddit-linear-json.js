I remember the scramble to get beta invites from people who had Gmail - \"Oh, James has a GMail account? I better hit him up for an invite link!\" Furthermore, they were entirely *free*. Detractors would argue that this made them somewhat anti-competitive, because they were offering for free a comparable (and in many cases, better) product than that others were charging for - I'm looking at you, MS Office, which is now the preserve for businesses or those who need the more refined and advanced functions of Excel, and not 'literally everyone who has to write anything, ever'. But for the consumer, this was amazing.",

It seems like it to us because we're tech nerds, and we're constantly watching all the announcements and developer conferences and stuff. But there have been no TV adverts or general fanfare among the non-tech-obsessed public (at least in the UK), and your average consumer knows nothing about Stadia's existence, unlike when, say, a new PlayStation gets released and you hear about it everywhere. Most of the friends that I've shown Stadia to haven't heard of it before and have been blown away by it, suggesting that Google has a great product on their hands that they're still refining. It's a beta phase in all but name.",
