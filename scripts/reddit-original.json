The issue is not that marijuana sticks around for longer than other drug metabolites, the issue is that our drug tests are flawed in the context of employment.\n\nPut simply, recreational drug taking in and of itself is a matter between an individual and law enforcement. If an employee is convicted of a drug related crime then an employer should be free to fire them, but we don't allow vigilante justice and firing people for the suspicion of crimes (or at least we shouldn't). A drug screen cannot possibly demonstrate that a law has been broken; the person might use prescribed marijuana or have been injected with cocaine as a local anaesthetic.\n\nWhere drug use is the concern of an employer is where it leads to impairment of the employee's ability to do their job. This is of course grounds for disciplinary action or even firing. However at present with the exception of alcohol we have no tests for drug-induced impairment. It is thus impossible to say whether a positive test for drugs has resulted in impairment of the worker during work time.\n\nIt seems to me that the impairment itself is the issue, and that can be grounds for disciplinary action without any need for a drugs test. Someone who comes into work excessively tired and falls asleep or makes lots of errors would be reprimanded or fired, and they would of course pass a drugs test. Does that logic make sense?\n\nOn a different note, I also believe that the benefits of routing drug screening are negligible in terms of improving workplace safety, as demonstrated by the lack of excess problems in places where such screening is illegal.

Someone who comes into work excessively tired and falls asleep or makes lots of errors would be reprimanded or fired, and they would of course pass a drugs test. Does that logic make sense?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a different note, I also believe that the benefits of routing drug screening are negligible in terms of improving workplace safety, as demonstrated by the lack of excess problems in places where such screening is illegal. However the damage is high: screening can be used as an excuse for not hiring people, and it is open to significant opportunity to discriminate against those on prescription medication who may well be protected as disabled but will in practice struggle to fight against a failed drugs test.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does my argument persuade you at all?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": true, "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/103sqbf/cmv_preemployment_drug_testing_should_no_longer/j32p5yx/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1672939660.0, "author_flair_text": "28\u2206", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_103sqbf", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/changemyview", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "changemyview", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "j3326v0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": "zuneza", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1672944252.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_103sqbf", "score": 1, "author_fullname": "t2_7xxzd", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "Everyone here seems to be forgetting that fatigue is FAR more hazardous for the performance of high risk professions (driving, construction, piloting, surgeon).\n\nI know a lot of people that use cannabis to ensure they have a good rest every night and for a lot of them, it's the only thing that works.\n\nI would rather have someone well rested with barely any residual effects over someone that was mandated they can't consume something on their personal time and thus, is fatigued every day at work.\n\nYou can't reliably test for fatigue, but it's the silent killer of a lot of negligent deaths.
